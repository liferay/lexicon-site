### Usage

Navbars in DE are used inside applications to provide navigation among their different pieces.

A navbar can contain one or several entry points in the form of tabs at the leftmost side and search field at the rightmost side. In case there are many options to navigate, you can make use of a dropdown to host some of the navigating options.

The search textfield activity must work only over the active option in the navigation bar.

When the viewport resizes to smaller screen sizes the navbar entries collapse intro a dropdown where the active screen gets populated and selected in the dropdown.
