## Variations

### Accordion

Panels can be collapsible. Whenever there is a collapsible panel the header must include a disclosure icon as an affordance to let the user understand that open and close actions can be performed. Please, see that when a panel is open the header is highlighted with a blue line below it marking the active state.
