## Autocomplete text field

<span class="label label-secondary">PENDING</span>

An autocomplete text field is an input that offers the user text suggestions while they type.

## Search field
<span class="label label-secondary">PENDING</span>

A search field is pretty similar to an autocomplete text field, but the field states are defined to reflect search results.

### Usage

A search field can have auto completion to display a list of options below the field.
* The list below must be as wide as the search field.
* The list must update its content as the user types.
* Characters in each entry must be semibold and marked in regular as the user types.

## Date Field or Date Select
<span class="label label-secondary">PENDING</span>

A date select lets the user select a date. This is similar to HTML5's data select and includes the same functionality. We recommend that you use native date selects since users are familiar with them. Use this one on the desktop viewport.

## Numeric field 
<span class="label label-secondary">PENDING</span>

Use numeric fields when you require the user to enter an integer or float value. Numeric fields provide the added bonus of letting the user increase and decrease the value via the arrow keys and internal field buttons.

## Password field
<span class="label label-secondary">PENDING</span>

An password field input is used when the user needs to enter a password.
